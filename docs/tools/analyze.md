# Analyze Tool - Smart File Analysis

**General-purpose code understanding and exploration through workflow-driven investigation**

The `analyze` tool provides comprehensive code analysis and understanding capabilities, helping you explore codebases, understand architecture, and identify patterns across files and directories. This workflow tool guides Claude through systematic investigation of code structure, patterns, and architectural decisions across multiple steps, gathering comprehensive insights before providing expert analysis.

## Thinking Mode

**Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens).** Use `high` for architecture analysis (comprehensive insights worth the cost) or `low` for quick file overviews (save ~6k tokens).

## How the Workflow Works

The analyze tool implements a **structured workflow** for thorough code understanding:

**Investigation Phase (Claude-Led):**
1. **Step 1**: Claude describes the analysis plan and begins examining code structure
2. **Step 2+**: Claude investigates architecture, patterns, dependencies, and design decisions
3. **Throughout**: Claude tracks findings, relevant files, insights, and confidence levels
4. **Completion**: Once analysis is comprehensive, Claude signals completion

**Expert Analysis Phase:**
After Claude completes the investigation (unless confidence is **certain**):
- Complete analysis summary with all findings
- Architectural insights and pattern identification
- Strategic improvement recommendations
- Final expert assessment based on investigation

This workflow ensures methodical analysis before expert insights, resulting in deeper understanding and more valuable recommendations.

## Example Prompts

**Basic Usage:**
```
"Use gemini to analyze main.py to understand how it works"
"Get gemini to do an architecture analysis of the src/ directory"
```

## Key Features

- **Analyzes single files or entire directories** with intelligent file filtering
- **Supports specialized analysis types**: architecture, performance, security, quality, general
- **Uses file paths (not content) for clean terminal output** while processing full content
- **Can identify patterns, anti-patterns, and refactoring opportunities**
- **Large codebase support**: Handle massive codebases with 1M token context models
- **Cross-file relationship mapping**: Understand dependencies and interactions
- **Architecture visualization**: Describe system structure and component relationships
- **Image support**: Analyze architecture diagrams, UML charts, flowcharts: `"Analyze this system diagram with gemini to understand the data flow and identify bottlenecks"`
- **Web search capability**: When enabled with `use_websearch` (default: true), the model can request Claude to perform web searches and share results back to enhance analysis with current documentation, design patterns, and best practices

## Analysis Types

**General Analysis (default):**
- Overall code structure and organization
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Data flow and control flow
- Design patterns and architectural decisions

**Architecture Analysis:**
- System-level design and component relationships
- Module dependencies and coupling
- Separation of concerns and layering
- Scalability and maintainability considerations

**Performance Analysis:**
- Potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Algorithmic complexity assessment
- Memory usage patterns
- I/O and database interaction efficiency

**Security Analysis:**
- Security patterns and potential vulnerabilities
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data protection and privacy considerations

**Quality Analysis:**
- Code quality metrics and maintainability
- Testing coverage and patterns
- Documentation completeness
- Best practices adherence

## Usage Examples

**Single File Analysis:**
```
"Analyze user_controller.py to understand the authentication flow with gemini"
```

**Directory Architecture Analysis:**
```
"Use pro to analyze the src/ directory architecture and identify the main components"
```

**Performance-Focused Analysis:**
```
"Analyze backend/api/ for performance bottlenecks with o3, focus on database queries"
```

**Security Assessment:**
```
"Use gemini pro to analyze the authentication module for security patterns and potential issues"
```

**Visual + Code Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this system architecture diagram along with the src/core/ implementation to understand the data flow"
```

**Large Codebase Analysis:**
```
"Analyze the entire project structure with gemini pro to understand how all components work together"
```

## Output Formats

**Summary Format:**
- High-level overview with key findings
- Main components and their purposes
- Critical insights and recommendations

**Detailed Format (default):**

## Best Practices

- **Be specific about goals**: Clearly state what you want to understand or discover

- **Include related files**: Analyze modules together for better context understanding
- **Leverage large context models**: Use Gemini Pro for comprehensive codebase analysis
- **Combine with visual context**: Include architecture diagrams or documentation
- **Use continuation**: Build on previous analysis for deeper understanding

## Advanced Features

**Large Codebase Support:**
With models like Gemini Pro (1M context), you can analyze extensive codebases:
```
"Analyze the entire microservices architecture across all service directories"
```
