# Secaudit Tool - Comprehensive Security Audit

**Systematic OWASP-based security assessment with compliance evaluation through workflow-driven investigation**

The `secaudit` tool provides comprehensive security auditing capabilities with systematic OWASP Top 10 assessment, compliance framework evaluation, 
and threat modeling. This workflow tool guides Claude through methodical security investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure 
thorough vulnerability assessment, security pattern analysis, and compliance verification before providing expert analysis.

**Important**: AI models may not identify all security vulnerabilities. Always perform additional manual security reviews, 
penetration testing, and verification.

## How the Workflow Works

The secaudit tool implements a **structured 6-step security workflow** that ensures comprehensive security assessment:

**Investigation Phase (Claude-Led):**
1. **Step 1**: Security Scope Analysis - Claude identifies application type, tech stack, attack surface, and compliance requirements
2. **Step 2**: Authentication & Authorization Assessment - Analyzes auth mechanisms, session management, and access controls
3. **Step 3**: Input Validation & Data Security - Reviews input handling, data protection, and injection vulnerabilities
4. **Step 4**: OWASP Top 10 (2021) Review - Systematic assessment of all OWASP categories with specific findings
5. **Step 5**: Dependencies & Infrastructure - Security analysis of third-party components and deployment configurations
6. **Step 6**: Compliance & Risk Assessment - Evaluation against specified compliance frameworks and risk prioritization

**Expert Analysis Phase:**
After Claude completes the investigation (unless confidence is **certain**):
- Complete security assessment summary with all vulnerabilities and evidence
- OWASP Top 10 systematic findings with severity classifications
- Compliance framework gap analysis and remediation recommendations
- Risk-prioritized remediation roadmap based on threat level and business impact

**Special Note**: If you want Claude to perform the entire security audit without calling another model, you can include "don't use any other model" in your prompt, and Claude will complete the full workflow independently.

## Model Recommendation

This tool particularly benefits from Gemini Pro or O3 models due to their advanced reasoning capabilities and large context windows, which allow comprehensive security analysis across complex codebases. Security audits require understanding subtle attack vectors and cross-component interactions that benefit from deeper analytical capabilities.

## Example Prompts

```
Perform a secaudit with o3 on this e-commerce web application focusing on payment processing security and PCI DSS compliance
```

```
Use secaudit to conduct a comprehensive security audit of the authentication system, threat level high, focus on enterprise 
security patterns and HIPAA compliance
```

## Pro Tip: Multi-Scope Security Assessment

**You can run parallel security audits for different application components:**

```
Start separate sub-tasks, in one start a secaudit for critical payment processing components focusing on PCI DSS with gemini pro, 
and in the other for user management focusing on OWASP authentication vulnerabilities with o4-mini, then combine into a unified 
security remediation plan using planner 
```
